## How to Run the Code

### Setting Up Files
We use the same file structure as the exercises and assignments. If you already have the file structure set up, just make a new folder called FinalProject under the 381-581 folder and place Recidivism.csv there.
1. Enable Google Colaboratory as an app on your Google Drive account
2. Create a new Google Colab notebook, this will also create a "Colab Notebooks" directory under "MyDrive" i.e. /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks
3. Create the following directory structure in your Google Drive /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CPSC 381-581: Machine Learning/FinalProject
4. Download 'Recidivism.csv' into /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CPSC 381-581: Machine Learning/FinalProject so that its absolute path is '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CPSC 381-581: Machine Learning/FinalProject'
5. Download 'main.ipynb.' It should work in any folder, but for simplicity, place it in content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/CPSC 381-581: Machine Learning/FinalProject. Alternatively, you can run our notebook using the link here, as long as you have the .csv file in the correct position: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TvSakSJ0hTcq4VPOL5WTNtZIxLNv9tIl?authuser=1#scrollTo=0ypiRRrHd3fW
